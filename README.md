## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I would like to highlight the way I center the panel where the QR code is using the position: absolute property, which I didn't know how to use very well.

```css
main {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

I learned it through DevQuest, and I really liked the outcome.

### Continued development

I will continue to work on HTML and CSS projects to improve myself. In the future, I plan to implement JavaScript in my projects.

### Useful resources

- [responsive-viewer](https://github.com/skmail/responsive-viewer) - This helped me because it displays various screen resolutions, which is very helpful for page responsiveness. I really liked this extension and plan to use it in my future projects.
